## Framework Migration

**From**: .NET 9 → **To**: .NET 8

### Reason for Migration
Azure Functions v4 does not yet support .NET 9. To ensure compatibility and successful deployment to Azure, all projects have been migrated to .NET 8, which is the current LTS version supported by Azure Functions.

### Package Versions Updated
- Entity Framework Core: 9.0.0 → 8.0.11
- ASP.NET Core: 9.0.0 → 8.0.11
- Microsoft.Extensions.*: 9.0.0 → 8.0.1
- Language Version: C# 13 → C# 12

## Next Steps

1. **Database Migration**: Run Entity Framework migrations to create the database schema
2. **Azure Deployment**: Deploy the application to Azure using the provided setup scripts
3. **Configuration**: Set up connection strings and Azure service configurations
4. **Testing**: Verify the API endpoints and Azure Functions functionality

## Build Command

To build the entire solution:

```bash
cd c:\EDIProcessing
dotnet build
```

All projects should build without errors. The Infrastructure project may show warnings about async method implementations, which are non-blocking and can be addressed in future iterations.
